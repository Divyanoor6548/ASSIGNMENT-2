            The story of Anni Deya Mazak Ae revolves around Ammy Virk’s character as a blind man. He travels to the UK to be with his sister-in-law and encounters another man who is also visually impaired. They strike up a friendship and eventually, Ammy Virk’s character meets a girl with whom he develops a close bond.
As their friendship blossoms into love, the story poses the question of whether the girl’s family would accept their relationship or not as Ammy Virk’s character is a visually impaired person. The movie promises to deliver side-splitting comedy along with an unconventional love story.
